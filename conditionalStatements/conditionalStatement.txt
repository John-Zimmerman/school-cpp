// CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS NOTES //

A "conditional statement" or a "conditional", is a logical process where a rule or set of rules is followed by a condition. Simply, if said rule is met then a set condition happens. A simple representation of this in the real world could be shown like this:

    Example:
        "If I do my homework, I get my allowance." If doing my homework represents the rule, the condition is getting my allowance.

The "If" statememt is a conditional that represents the example above. Getting your allowance or not is reliant on IF you do your homework. Lets write some psuedo-code that represents this condtional statement.


    IF
homework is done,
    Then    
recieve allowance.
    END


 Lets add another condition. Again, do your homework, get allowance. Else, you get grounded. This is a slightly more complex condtional statement called the Else statement. This could be shown like this.


    IF
homework is done,
    THEN 
recieve allowance.
    ELSE
get grounded.
    END
         
Lets make the conditional statement significantly more complex using our homework example. Let's say: If you do your homework and get above a 90%, you get your allowance. If you get less than 90% but more than 70%, you get nothing. If you score less than 70%, you get grounded. This would be represented with the "Else If" conditional statement.


    IF
homework score => 90%
    THEN
recieve allowance.
    ELSE IF
homework score < 90% > 70%
    THEN
get nothing.
    ELSE
get grounded.

// SUMMARY //

C++ has the following conditional statements:
    - Use IF to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true.
    - Use ELSE to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false.
    - Use ELSE IF to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false.

C++ Specific examples using standard IO.

// IF // 


if (20 > 18){
    std::cout << "20 is greater than 18" << std::endl;
}

(Outputs: 20 is greater than 18)


< ELSE >


int time = 20;
if (time < 18){
    std::cout << "Good day." << std::endl;
} else {
    std::cout << "Good evening." << std::endl;
}


< ELSE IF >

int time = 22;
if (time < 10){
    std::cout << "Good Morning." << std::endl;
} else if (time < 20 ) {
    std::cout << "Good Day." << std::cout;
} else {
    std::cout << "Good Evening." << std::cout;
}
